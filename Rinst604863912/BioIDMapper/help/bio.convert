_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function is main interface for mapping service. It can
     support NCBI  mapping and UniProt mapping, from gene level,
     protein level, functional level, and metabolomic level.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     bio.convert(id_list = "character", from = "numeric", to = "numeric")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 id_list: the list of biological ids

    from: Biokey number for source biological type. It can be found by
          bio.type()

      to: Biokey number for destination biological type. It can be
          found by bio.type()

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     It converts a list of ids from one biological type to another. For
     detail, please check vegnette "demonstration" section.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a result matrix will be returned with source type in the first
     column and the destination type in the last column
